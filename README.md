# ai-sandbox

This repository contains a simple static website showcasing stringed instruments often used by folk singers. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the site.


After pushes to `main`, a GitHub Actions workflow publishes the site to GitHub Pages. Once the workflow succeeds and Pages is enabled in the repository settings, you can preview the site at `https://<github-username>.github.io/ai-sandbox/`.
